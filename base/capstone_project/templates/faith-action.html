            <p>Faith 'n Action is a web application designed to modernize the Knights of Columbus (KoFC) Lucena District by enhancing transparency, engagement, and efficiency in donation and community service. This platform serves as a centralized hub for members, officers, and the public, offering secure donation tracking via blockchain, member monitoring, and event management. Key features include a transparent donation portal (with immutable ledger records), member tier systems, attendance tracking, and forums. By digitizing operations, the app ensures accountability in fundraising, simplifies member coordination, and preserves the council's legacy through a digital historical archive. Ultimately, Faith 'n Action empowers the KoFC Lucena to strengthen trust with donors, boost member participation, and amplify their impact in serving faith and community—all while upholding the order's core values of charity, unity, and fraternity.</p>
